###1. Introduction

When I was an undergraduate student, I always check this course status to see some staffs. But never learn it for entirety. I know I have to do this these days. Still challenges, but funny.  

* [Computing building blocks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes)
* [Language Notes]( https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/)

###2. Recommanding programming styles

* [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)
* [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
* The practice of programming(A programming book)
* Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
* C Traps and Pitfalls

###3. Project 0

&emsp;The `traceback()` function is a useful method for debugging. OS uses it to dump enough information when an emergency situation happens, such as a **Segment fault**. I will practice to write a `traceback()` function in this project.

###4. Tips

*	Designing before coding. 

	For systems programming, it is very important to think out crucial data structures and algorithms ahead of time since they become important primitives for the rest of the system. 

*	Always Commenting. 

	In this project, I used [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) for documentations.

* About design
	
	When works on a solution, think hard to come up with a few feasible approaches and then do tradeoff varifications. Practice the best approach.
