###1. Introduction

When I was a undergraduate student, I always check this course status to see some staffs. But never learn it for entirety. I know I have to do this these days. Still challenges, but funny.  

###2. Recommand programming style

* Extreme programming
* Pair programming
* The practice of programming(A programming book)
* Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
* C Traps and Pitfalls

###3. Project 0

&emsp;The `traceback()` function is a useful method for debugging. OS use it to dump enough information when an emergency situation happens, such as a **Segment fault**. I will practice to write a `traceback()` function in this project.
