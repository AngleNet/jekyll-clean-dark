###1. Confusing Language blocks

####1.1 Interface

Come soon

####1.2 Channel

Come soon

####1.3 `make` VS `new`

According to the [Official explanation](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new), `new` does not initialize the memory, only zeros it and return the address. `make(T, args)` serves a purpose different from new(T). It creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an initialized (not zeroed) value of type T (not *T). So what `make` returns is usable immediately while what `new` returns needs further initializing if zeroed content can not be used. 

###2. Go idioms 

####2.1 Atomic operation

```go
	countCh := make(chan int)
    count := <- countCh
    count++
    countCh <- count
```

####2.2 Check whether the channel is full

```go
	if len(ch) == cap(ch){
    }else{
    }
```
