#### Introduction

Most of what I talk about in this notes are from some famous C programming books and my personal programming expeirence. C is an old programming language and provides the system programmer with the most freedom. You can do anything with it.

####1. Function declaration

*	Call a funtion witch no arguments and site at address 0

	`(*(void(*) ()) 0) ();` 

	Another declaration
    
    ```c
    typedef void (* funcptr)();
    (* (funcptr)0)();
	``` 
    
    The secret behind this statement is the priority of parentheses is higher than asterisk
    
####2. Parallel in linux

* 	Fork 3 processes:

	```c
    #include <unistd.h> 	//defines system calls and useful types.
    #include <sys/types.h>	//defines system call types, but more.
   	
    pid_t pid = 0;
    int i = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
    	pid = fork();
        if(pid < 0){
        	//process creation error.
        }else if(pid == 0){
        	//child process.
            break;
        }else{
        	//parent process.
        }
    }
    ```
    
#### Header files

* stdlib.h and malloc.h 
	stdlib.h is a standard C header that declares among other things the malloc(), calloc(), free() functions. This is the header you should include.
	malloc.h is a non-standard header, found on many systems where it often defines additional functions specific to the malloc implementation used by that platform.
